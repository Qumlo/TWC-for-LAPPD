This is the Python code I used in my master project. I did not include C++ part.

If any one is interested, I put a run_419.root so you can try it on your own.

Also, the fitting for each single channel of run 419 is inside, check fitting_channel_419 and crystalball_fit_for_all_channels_419ï¼Œthese PDF.
